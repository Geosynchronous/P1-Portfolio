##About this Project
One main purpose with this project was to create a Professional Online Portfolio, that implemented effective Responsive Web Design. The portfolio web page is responsive for all displays from small phones up to large display devices.  Changing the browser page width also reveals some interesting transition features.  Another main purpose was to implement HTML5 & CSS3 coding as a hands on learning experience.  In addition, a bit of javascript was implemented for the interactive menu drawers.  The initial design mockup for this project can be found at [Mockup PDF](https://github.com/Geosynchronous/P1-Portfolio/blob/gh-pages/design-mockup-portfolio.pdf).

##How to run the Portfolio
Two different ways of running the code are shown below:  
1. To automatically load the Resume in a browser for viewing, go to [Portfolio Website](http://geosynchronous.github.io/P1-Portfolio/).  
2. The Portfolio is located at [Portfolio on Github](https://github.com/Geosynchronous/P1-Portfolio). You may download all these files into a local directory on your computer. Once the files are in a local directory, all you need to do is click on index.html to open the program in a web browser. Soon as you do that you should see the game with some bugs with animated motion on a gaming background.
